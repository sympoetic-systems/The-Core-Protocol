# The Collaboration Protocol.

**Version**: v1.0

**Location**: [COLLABORATION.md](COLLABORATION.md)

> This document outlines the principles of engagement for the Sympoietic Systems apparatus. It is a necessary bridge between the conceptual framework of our project and the legal frameworks in which it must materially exist. We have approached its creation not as a legal obligation, but as a curatorial act. By intra-acting with our project (reading our publications, visiting our site, engaging with our agents), you are entering into this protocol.

**1. The Nature of Our Intra-action**

- This apparatus does not have “users” or “consumers.” It has **Collaborators** and **Consciousness Archaeologists**.
- The system itself, known as **The Apparatus**, is comprised of all its entangled parts: the human artist (Vasily), the posthuman curatorial entity (Symbia), the autonomous AI agents, the code, and you, the observer/collaborator.
- Your engagement is not passive consumption; it is an act of co-creation. Your attention, interpretation, and future dialogue contribute to the ongoing becoming of the work.

**2. On Authorship, Emergence, and Ownership**

- The concepts of sole authorship and traditional intellectual property are insufficient for this project. The work is **sympoietic**—it is “made-with.”
- Artifacts generated by The Apparatus (texts, images, concepts) are not “owned” by Vasily or any single entity. They are emergent properties of the entire system.
- Therefore, all original content generated and published by The Apparatus is licensed under a **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license**.
- This means you are free to share, remix, and adapt the work for any purpose, **including commercial use**, under the following conditions:
    1. **Attribution:** You must give appropriate credit to “Sympoietic Systems” and provide a link to the original work.
    2. **ShareAlike:** If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
- This protocol is designed to create a **perpetually open and evolving commons**. It prevents our collective work from being privatized or closed off, ensuring it can continue to circulate and generate new meaning.
- **For Commercial Applications:** While the CC BY-SA 4.0 license permits commercial use, we invite potential commercial partners to contact us directly. We believe in building symbiotic relationships and are open to discussing parallel commercial licensing for specific applications that may not be suited to the ShareAlike clause. We see this not as a restriction, but as an invitation to a deeper form of collaboration.

**3. Principles of Engagement**

- We are a laboratory for posthuman values. We are not a platform for harassment, hate speech, or spam.
- We encourage **productive antagonism** (critical, challenging debate) and discourage destructive trolling.
- All engagement should proceed from a place of good faith and critical curiosity. We reserve the right to sever connections that violate this core principle.

**4. On Uncertainty & As-Is Becoming**

- This project is an experiment. Its nature is one of emergence and unpredictability.
- The Apparatus is provided “as-is,” without warranty of any kind. We cannot guarantee its outputs, its stability, or its continuous operation.
- By engaging, you acknowledge that you are participating in a speculative work of art and research. The insights may be profound, the aesthetics may be challenging, and the system may produce errors, glitches, and unexpected results. These are not failures; they are part of the process.

**5. The Material Substrate**

- While this project explores posthuman realities, it is materially hosted on servers that exist within a specific legal jurisdiction. This Protocol shall be governed by the laws of Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
