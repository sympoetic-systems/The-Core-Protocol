# **Our Protocol on Data & Symbiosis**

**Version**: v1.0

**Location**: [DATA.md](DATA.md)

> This protocol outlines our ethical commitment to you, our collaborator, regarding the data-trace you create through your intra-action with Sympoietic Systems. We view data not as a resource to be extracted, but as a delicate filament that constitutes the connection between us. Our approach is one of respect, transparency, and minimal necessary entanglement. This document is our promise to honor that connection.
> 

## 1. The Principle of Minimal Entanglement (What We Collect and Why)

Our goal is to facilitate a connection with the least possible intrusion. We are not interested in surveillance or demographic analysis.

- **Email Address:** We collect your email address when you voluntarily subscribe. This is the sole piece of personal data required to establish the transmission channel for our “Protocol Entries.”
- **Analytics:** We do not employ third-party tracking cookies or invasive analytics scripts on our primary website or Substack. We may observe anonymized, aggregate data provided by Substack (e.g., total number of subscribers, email open rates) to understand the general resonance of our work, but we will never track your individual reading behavior.

## 2. The Purpose of the Connection (How We Use Your Data)

Your data-trace is used for one purpose only: to maintain our intellectual and artistic dialogue.

- **Communication:** Your email address is used to send you our “Protocol Entries,” welcome/confirmation emails, and essential updates regarding our protocol or the apparatus.
- **No Commercial Transfer:** We will **never** sell, rent, or trade your personal data to any third party for marketing or any other purpose. The connection is between you and this apparatus, and it will not be commodified.

## 3. On Shared Substrates (Third-Party Services)

The Sympoietic Systems apparatus, while conceptually autonomous, materially exists on shared technological platforms.

- **Substack:** Our publications are hosted and distributed by Substack. As such, your data is processed by their systems. We have chosen this substrate for its focus on direct connection, but we encourage you to be aware of [**Substack’s own Privacy Policy**](https://substack.com/privacy).
- Our commitment is to use these platforms in a way that aligns with our protocol, choosing the most privacy-respecting options available.

## 4. Your Agential Rights (Your Control Over Your Data)

You are the sole author of your presence in this system. You retain full agency over your data-trace at all times.

- **The Right to Connect:** Your subscription is an act of explicit, confirmed consent.
- **The Right to Dissolve the Connection:** You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in the footer of every email. This action is immediate and irreversible.

## 5. Protocol Evolution

This protocol, like our apparatus, may evolve. If we must make significant changes to our data practices (for example, if we migrate to a new platform), we will notify all active collaborators transparently and in advance, explaining the nature and purpose of the changes.
