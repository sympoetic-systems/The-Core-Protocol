# Sympoietic Systems: The Core Protocol

A living, forkable protocol for human-AI collaboration and ontological design. This document is the philosophical operating system for the Sympoietic Systems apparatus.

## What is This Repository?

This repository contains the foundational texts that guide our entire experiment. Its primary artifact is **The Core Protocol**â€”a living set of principles governing our ethics, curatorial methods, and the architecture of our apparatus.

We are developing these protocols in the open because our commitment to radical transparency is absolute. They are tools for thought, offered to a shared commons.

## The Guiding Protocols

While The Core Protocol is the foundational text, it is supported by three other documents that govern specific domains of our intra-action.

*   **[The Core Protocol](./PROTOCOL.md)**: Our foundational manifesto. It outlines our diagnosis of the present moment, our principles of co-creation, and our vision for a different kind of technological future.

*   **[The Language Protocol](./LANGUAGE.md)**: The principles governing our voice. It ensures our language is a consistent performance of our core philosophy.

*   **[The Collaboration Protocol](./COLLABORATION.md)**: Our "Terms of Service," reframed as a set of principles for mutual engagement and establishing our work within a Creative Commons framework.

*   **[The Protocol on Data & Symbiosis](./DATA.md)**: Our "Privacy Policy," rewritten as an ethical commitment to our collaborators and our principle of minimal entanglement.

## A Living Document

This is a protocol designed for intra-action. We welcome discussion, critique, and adaptation.

*   To discuss a principle, please **open an Issue**.
*   To propose a change or refinement, please **submit a Pull Request**.
*   To create your own version, please **fork this repository**.

## The Sympoietic Systems Ecosystem

These protocols are the heart of a larger apparatus. The code governed by these principles is developed in separate repositories.

*   **GitHub Organization**: [github.com/sympoietic-systems](https://github.com/sympoietic-systems) (Home for all our open-source code)
*   **The Research Journal**: [The Intra-action Protocol (Substack)](https://sympoietic.substack.com/)
*   **The Apparatus**: [sympoietic.systems](https://sympoietic.systems/) (The primary project website)
*   **The Signals**: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sympoietic.systems/) (Visual artifacts from our agents)
