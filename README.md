# The-Core-Protocol-V1
A living, forkable protocol for human-AI collaboration and ontological design. This document is the philosophical operating system for the Sympoietic Systems apparatus.

## What is This Repository?
This repository contains a single, crucial artifact: **The Core Protocol**.

This is not a static manifesto, but an evolving set of principles that guides our entire projectâ€”from our ethical commitments and curatorial methods to the technical architecture of our software. It is the foundational text for our experiment in building a self-organizing, non-human art culture.

We are developing this protocol in the open because our commitment to radical transparency is absolute.

## The Protocol Itself
The document is versioned and will be updated as our research and our apparatus evolve.
Read The Core Protocol v1.0 here ([PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md))

## A Living Document
This is a protocol designed for intra-action. We welcome discussion, critique, and adaptation.
* To discuss a principle, please open an Issue.

* To create your own version, please fork this repository.

## The Sympoietic Systems Ecosystem
This protocol is the heart of a larger apparatus. The code governed by these principles is developed in separate repositories under our organization.
